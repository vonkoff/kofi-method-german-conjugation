Inspired by [Lisardo's Kofi Method](https://www.asiteaboutnothing.net/w_ultimate_italian_conjugation.html#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20KOFI%20Method,to%20formally%20study%20the%20language)

## Conjugation Forms Included

- Präsens (Present Tense): "Du sprichst" (You speak)
- Präteritum (Simple Past Tense): "Du sprachst" (You spoke)
- Konjunktiv II Präteritum (Subjunctive Past Tense): "Du sprächest" (You spoke)
- Imperativ (Imperative Mood): "Sprich!" (Speak!)
- Partizip I (Present Participle): "sprechend" (speaking)
- Partizip II (Past Participle): "gesprochen" (spoken)
- Infinitiv mit zu (Infinitive with "zu"): "zu sprechen" (to speak)

These forms are the building blocks of German verb conjugation. Mastery of these elements allows learners to construct and understand a variety of complex tenses with minimal memorization of additional forms.

## Why Not the Rest of the Forms?

While other tenses and forms exist in German, they can often be formed using the key forms included in this deck:

- Perfekt (Present Perfect): haben/sein (in Präsens form) + Partizip II
  "Du hast gesprochen" (You have spoken)

- Plusquamperfekt (Past Perfect): haben/sein (in Präteritum form) + Partizip II
  "Du hattest gesprochen" (You had spoken)

- Futur I (Future I): werden (in Präsens form) + Infinitiv
  "Du wirst sprechen" (You will speak)

- Futur II (Future Perfect): werden (in Präsens form) + Partizip II + haben/sein (Infinitiv)
  "Du wirst gesprochen haben" (You will have spoken)

- Konjunktiv I and II (Subjunctive I and II): Based on Präsens or Präteritum forms
  Konjunktiv I: "Du sprechest" (You speak, indirect speech)


You should still give a glance at the other forms and can do so through [Duden.de](https://www.duden.de/konjugation/sprechen).
